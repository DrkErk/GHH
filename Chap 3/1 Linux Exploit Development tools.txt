TOOL: ldd (ldd /bin/ls)
	-Displays the shared libraries loaded by programs at runtime. (These libraries have a suffix of .so (shared object) and consist of individual files that contain a list of functions)
		-(The reason shared libraries are used is to promote code reusability, writing smaller programs, and making large applications easier to maintain.)
		-(attack opportunities range from finding weak file permissions and using rpath to replace shared libraries with evil ones, leaking address of shared library, and even 		  abusing its interesting gadgets to achieve execution flow control with ROP/JOP code reuse attack techniques)

TOOL: objdump
	-CLI disassembler and also can get importent information about exe files and objs.
		- "-R" option is used to display the list of functions in the GOT
		- "-M intel" tells objdump to use intel syntax mode instead of the default AT&T
		- "-d" short for "--disassemble"
		- "-j (.plt which is <section>)" specifies the section we want to display (PLT)
	-?Get good with usage, what is the usage?
